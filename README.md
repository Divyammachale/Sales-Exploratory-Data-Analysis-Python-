Understanding buying patterns across different customer segments is crucial for optimizing inventory management. By analyzing sales data considering age, gender, occupation, and sales amount,
 we can gain valuable insights to tailor inventory accordingly. For example, analyzing past sales might reveal that young professionals in the tech sector prioritize specific electronics gadgets,
 while families with young children favor particular clothing brands. This information allows us to predict future demand and stock the right products in the right quantities, minimizing overstocking
 and understocking scenarios. Moreover, analyzing gender-specific buying trends can ensure gender-balanced representation in our inventory. Ultimately, this data-driven approach to inventory management
 leads to increased sales, reduced costs, and a more satisfying customer experience.
